## Topics

1. **Read Quality assessment.** Using bioinformatics tools to check the quality of the reads.
2. **De novo assembly.**  Producing genome assemblies based on PacBio, Nanopore and Illumina.
3. **Assembly comparison.** The genome assemblies based on the different types of data might have different results. Here we will compare the results and investigate the found differences between them. 
4. **Assembly base Quality check using mRNA sequence.** We will use Illumina RNASeq to indentify SNPs and other discrepancies between the assemblies and the RNA reads. We will study the effects these assembly errors have on downstream analyzes.
